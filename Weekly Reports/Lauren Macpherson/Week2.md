## Week 2 Report ##

This week, my focus was on fixing any issues with the Order API, as well as converting from the H2 database configuration we started with to a MySQL database. I also know that we need to deploy our database to Google Cloud, so I will be looking over the documentation shared in Lab 5 regarding this process and taking steps as necessary. From a quick look-over, it seems like most of the steps will be taking place once we actually deploy it in the cloud, not edits to the files themselves. Still, I'm going to prepare for that. I will also be looking over the project requirements again and adding more cards.
