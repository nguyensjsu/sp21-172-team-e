### Accomplishment

This week, I finished Starbucks Card service API with a H2 database.

https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-team-e/commit/e959803301a9a9a4f22614aeedb658e3689db0bb

For next week, I will convert h2 database to mysql database.

### Challenge 
This task is very similar to the Lab 6, but I didn't do well on it. I have to learned Spring Rest API from https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/, and finally finished my card api version 1.
While I was working on the API, I put WebController and APIController togetherï¼Œbut later I realized I should split them to make our structure more clear.
